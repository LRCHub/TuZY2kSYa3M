You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all

Nothing comes easy and that's a fact
Nothing comes easy but a broken back

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all

Nothing comes easy, it never will
Nothing comes easy but a broken will

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard

You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all
You've got to work hard, you've got to work hard
If you want anything at all

You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
So work hard

You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
So work hard

You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
So work hard
