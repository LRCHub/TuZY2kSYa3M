I work a double-shift on Monday
Tuesday, I get up before dawn
Wednesday, pouring coffee
Thursday night, I'm tending the bar

Well, when Friday finally rolls around
I call my rough and rowdy friends and we're honky-tonk loud

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I play harder

Now, I don't waste my time on
Manicures and spray-on tans
And I don't pay no never mind
To the callouses I've worn on my hands

You know that people just can't understand how
I'm the first to clock in but the last to pass out

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I play harder yeah, yeah, yeah

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I play harder
I'm a good-timin', American daughter
Redneck, blue collar
And I party down to my last dollar

I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I work hard, I work hard, I work hard
I play harder
